Research Paper
--------------

Over the course of the semester students will each write a research paper on a topic of their choosing. In order to assist the process of formulating and developing topics, students must meet the following intermediate deadlines:

*   Each student will provide a general topic by session 9, explaining why this topic is significant intellectually and perhaps also to them personally.
*   Each student is required to then meet with {{% resource_link "761196cc-7be6-496c-a7d7-cf3a2c892504" "Ece Turnator" %}}, Humanities and Digital Scholarship Librarian, MIT Libraries, to talk about the research for their project. This meeting should take place sometime between sessions 10 and 12.
*   By session 13, students will identify primary sources and will present their ideas to the class for a workshop discussion.
*   Final presentations will be during sessions 24 and 25. 
*   Final papers are due during session 26.
*   Graduate students will write 15–20 pages and undergraduates will write 10–12 pages, double-spaced.
